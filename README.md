# Instacart-Python
Career Foundry Data analyis project-Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
**#Objective**
We have been tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The idea is to learn about a variety of customers at Instacart and their purchasing behaviors to develop a targeted marketing strategy.
**#Data**
We were provided with datasets that contained all the customer information:

Orders
Orders_Products_Prior
Products
Customers
Departments
**#Key questions**
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
